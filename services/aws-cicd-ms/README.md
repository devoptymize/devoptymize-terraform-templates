## Description
![Image](./aws-cicd-ms.png)
AWS DevOps pipeline architecture -ci/cd for nodejs backend application , with this end user will be able to deploy nodejs backend application . The architecture provides a robust and scalable environment with high availability, security, and monitoring capabilities. It follows best practices to ensure a well-architected AWS infrastructure that can handle your applicationâ€™s demands while maintaining your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
The goal is to create the pipeline which creates the below-given architecture which includes AWS code pipeline with stages (source stage, build stage ), and SNS notification.
- Who can use AWS DevOps pipeline architecture - CI/CD for Nodejs backend application:
    - Developers responsible for writing Node.js backend code can use the CI/CD pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their applications. They can focus on coding while relying on the automated pipeline to handle the deployment process.
    - DevOps engineers are instrumental in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines. They can leverage this blueprint to create an efficient and automated deployment process for Node.js applications, ensuring consistency and speed in releases
    - Infrastructure engineers may collaborate on the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components of the blueprint, ensuring that the AWS infrastructure supporting the Node.js application is defined, versioned, and managed as code.
    - Release managers can orchestrate the release process using the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the correct version of the Node.js application is deployed to production and other environments.
    - QA teams can leverage the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy different versions of the Node.js application for testing. Automated testing steps integrated into the pipeline ensure the quality of the deployed code.
    - Can be utilized by companies of various sizes and industries such as Technology, E-commerce, Financial, Healthcare and Life Sciences companies etc that develop and deploy Node.js applications for backend services. Many organizations across various sectors can benefit from implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline for Node.js applications on AWS.

## Introduction
- This Terraform scripts are used to create various AWS resources, including a AWS CodePipeline ,S3 Bucket for Artifacts,AWS SNS for Notifications,IAM Roles and policies
- The main.tf, variable.tf, provider.tf, and backend.tf files are typically used in a Terraform project to organize and configure your infrastructure code

## Installation
Dependencies to create the AWS resource using Terraform: 
- Make sure Terraform is installed.
